The XMPP adapter requires only 3 (5 if you need specify server\nand port) environment variables to be set to able to use it.\n\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_USERNAME`\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_PASSWORD`\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_ROOMS`\n\nOptional:\n\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_HOST` The host name you want to connect to if its different than\n  what is in the username jid.\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_PORT` The port to connect to on the jabber server.\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_LEGACYSSL` Set to 1 to enable legacy SSL port.  This requires\n  the host to be defined.\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_PREFERRED_SASL_MECHANISM` Used to change the encoding used for SASL.\n* `HUBOT_XMPP_DISALLOW_TLS` Prevent upgrading the connection to a secure one via TLS.\n\n`HUBOT_XMPP_ROOMS` can be a comma separated list of rooms to join.  If\nyour rooms require passwords you should use the `jid:password` syntax.\nRoom passwords cannot contain `,`. Room names must be the full jid of the \nroom for example `dev@conference.jabber.example.org`.\n\n## Installation\n\nAfter installing `hubot` with npm, you should create a standalone bot:\n\n\thubot -c ./my-bot\n\nAfter creating your new bot, you should modify the `package.json` and add the\n`hubot-xmpp` dependency. After running `npm install` you should be ready to configure\nand start up your bot.\n\n## Group chat vs private JID\n\nThe jabber protocol does not broadcast real user JID in groupchat presence\nstanzas unless the server/chat room is configured to do so.\n\nIf you need to send private chat in response to a groupchat message, use\nhubot's send method with the groupchat jid and `envelope.user.type = 'direct'`.\nhubot-xmpp will then automatically resolve the JID to a private\nchat JID, and private message the sender.\n\nIf you need to get the private chat JID, you can use\n'msg.envelope.user.privateChatJid' where msg is the parameter of hubot's\n\"route\" callback.\n\nExample:\n\n```coffeescript\nrobot.respond /talk to me$/i, ( msg ) ->\n  # Simply reply\n  msg.reply \"Hello #{msg.envelope.user.name}. Your private JID is #{msg.envelope.user.privateChatJID}\"\n\nrobot.respond /talk to me in private$/i, ( msg ) ->\n  msg.envelope.user.type = 'direct'\n  msg.send \"Hey #{msg.envelope.user.name}! You told me in room #{msg.envelope.user.room} to talk to you.\"\n```\n",
